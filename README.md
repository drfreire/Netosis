### Introduction

Neutrophils are the most abundant type of white blood cell in humans and have the second highest turnover rate of all cells with approximately 6 billion produced daily (Sender & Mills). Serving a key innate immunity role, these first-responders to injury and infection employ three main defensive strategies: degranulation, phagocytosis, and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps, NETosis. This extracellular DNA extrusion serves as a last resort to control invasion by pathogens and is both broadly effective and highly inflammatory. The employment of antimicrobial DNA/histone complexes is highly conserved across multi-cellular life (Neumann et al. 2020), and evidence suggest that the origin of DNA extracellular traps predates the emergence of metazoans (Zhang et al. 2016). NET release must be regulated to prevent tissue damage and chronic inflammation, and NETs are involved in the pathology of a wide array of immune-mediated conditions.

### Scripts
Contained are scripts for managing and processing Celigo images and analysing Celigo data. Classifier data from Cell Profiler is included for use with Nanolive images.

### Demos
The pipeline for Celigo NETosis data analysis is outlined for use with a provided example file.
